NEATEQN
=======

Neateqn is an eqn preprocessor for neatroff.  It implements most of
the extensions introduced by Groff's eqn preprocessor.  Neateqn,
neatroff and neatpost are available at http://litcave.rudi.ir/.

For using Computer Modern font in neateqn for brackets and radicals,
you first need to create troff font description files for neatroff
using the mktrfn program (you shall need the Type 1 version of
Computer Modern, which is available in most TeX distributions).  Then,
you can add these lines in your troff source (assuming the default eqn
roman font has not been changed with grfont command):

  .fp 11 cmsy10 cmsy10
  .fp 12 cmex10 cmex10
  .fspecial R cmsy10 cmex10

You can also redefine other symbols to use Computer Modern glyphs,
like those for summation and product:

  .EQ
  define sum @{vcenter roman "\N'summationdisplay'"}@
  define tsum @{vcenter roman "\N'summationtext'"}@
  define prod @{vcenter roman "\N'productdisplay'"}@
  define tprod @{vcenter roman "\N'producttext'"}@
  .EN

Neateqn uses TeX's text styles for inline equations, which make inline
equations more compact.  However, it does not provide smallover, which
is present in Groff's eqn.  A better solution, which would work for
anything and not just fractions, would be using a macro like this:

  .EQ
  define small @size -4@
  .EN

which can be used as $tsum sub i=0 to n small {left ( pile {n above i} right )}$.
