NEATEQN
=======

Neateqn is an eqn preprocessor for neatroff.  It implements most of
the extensions introduced by Groff's eqn preprocessor.  Neateqn,
neatroff and neatpost are available at http://litcave.rudi.ir/.

For using Computer Modern font in neateqn for brackets and radicals,
you first need to create troff font description files for neatroff
using the mktrfn program (you shall need the Type 1 version of
Computer Modern, which is available in most TeX distributions).  Then
you can add these lines in your troff source (assuming the default eqn
roman font has not been changed with grfont command):

  .fp 11 cmsy10 cmsy10
  .fp 12 cmex10 cmex10
  .fspecial R cmsy10 cmex10
