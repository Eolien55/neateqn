NEATEQN
=======

Neateqn is an eqn preprocessor for neatroff for typesetting
mathematics.  It implements most of the extensions introduced by
Groff's eqn preprocessor.  More information about neateqn and neatroff
is available at http://litcave.rudi.ir/.

For using Computer Modern font in neateqn for brackets and radicals,
neatroff font descriptions have to be generated using neatmkfn program
(the Type 1 version of Computer Modern is available in most TeX
distributions).  Then, the following lines activate the fonts in
neatroff (assuming the default eqn roman font has not been changed
with grfont command):

  .fp 11 cmsy10 cmsy10
  .fp 12 cmex10 cmex10
  .fspecial R cmsy10 cmex10

You can also redefine other symbols to use Computer Modern glyphs,
like those for summation and product:

  .EQ
  define sum @{vcenter roman "\N'summationdisplay'"}@
  define tsum @{vcenter roman "\N'summationtext'"}@
  define prod @{vcenter roman "\N'productdisplay'"}@
  define tprod @{vcenter roman "\N'producttext'"}@
  .EN

Neateqn uses TeX's text styles for inline equations, which make inline
equations more compact.  However, it does not provide smallover, which
is available in Groff's eqn.  Instead, in neateqn one can define a
macro like the following:

  .EQ
  define small @size -4@
  .EN

Which can be used as $tsum sub i=0 sup n small {left ( pile {n above i} right )}$.
